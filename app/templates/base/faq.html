                element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
                hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
                our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
                the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
